# Existimer

**Existimer** is a timer inspired by the Pomodoro technique—but stripped of purpose.

It is intentionally casual, even indifferent to productivity, while paradoxically being designed for long-term statistical analysis and possible future integration of machine learning. This tension is not a flaw but a core condition of the project.

Originally named **PotatoTask**, the project was provisionally renamed **Existimer**. The meaning of the name is still unresolved. For now, Existimer is conceived as a post-humanist timer—or something that exceeds post-humanism—less a tool for optimizing a human subject than a mechanism that allows a weakened or transparent subject (“the transparent stone”) to leave traces of existence through time.

In this sense, the project itself may be read as a contradictory practice:
a system that records, analyzes, and possibly predicts, while refusing to justify *why* time is recorded at all. Whether this counts as “post-post-humanism” is questionable; in any case, the project deliberately avoids grounding itself in ontology. Philosophical discussion is postponed and may be addressed elsewhere in a dedicated text.

This repository is under active development. There is no urgency to finalize documentation.

## Project Structure

* Development logs and learning notes are recorded in `lib/README.md`.
* Core source code lives in `existimer/lib`.
* Other files are primarily for Flutter configuration and debugging.

To use the project, create your own Flutter application, configure the required dependencies, and replace the `lib` directory with the one provided here.
